# Test Suite Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive unit tests have been added for the Spotify Wizardry house sorting algorithm.

## Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 35
- **Passing**: 35 (100%)
- **Failing**: 0
- **Code Coverage**: 100% statements, 92.85% branches, 100% functions

## Test Categories

### ✅ Basic House Assignment (4 tests)
Validates that each of the four houses can be correctly assigned based on their representative genres.

### ✅ Match Score Calculation (5 tests)
Tests the confidence scoring system including perfect matches, partial matches, zero matches, and case-insensitive/substring matching.

### ✅ Edge Cases (4 tests)
Ensures robustness with empty arrays, single items, very large lists, and special characters.

### ✅ House Percentages (4 tests)
Validates both raw and normalized percentage calculations, ensuring they sum to 100 and stay within valid ranges.

### ✅ Compatibility Scores (4 tests)
Tests the inter-house compatibility metric based on genre overlap and weighted calculations.

### ✅ Raw Scores (3 tests)
Validates the integer counts of genre matches per house.

### ✅ Tie-Breaking Behavior (2 tests)
Ensures deterministic and consistent results across identical inputs.

### ✅ Real-World Scenarios (5 tests)
Tests realistic genre combinations including:
- Electronic music enthusiasts
- Classical music lovers
- Indie/folk listeners
- Ambient/atmospheric fans
- Diverse multi-house taste

### ✅ Return Value Structure (4 tests)
Validates the complete shape and types of the `HouseSortResult` object.

## Key Achievements

1. **100% Function Coverage** - Every function in `houseSort.ts` is tested
2. **100% Statement Coverage** - Every line of code is executed during tests
3. **High Branch Coverage** - 92.85% of all code paths are tested
4. **Real-World Validation** - Tests include actual Spotify genre patterns
5. **Edge Case Protection** - Handles empty inputs, special characters, and unusual scenarios
6. **Type Safety** - All return values and structures are validated

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Standard test run
npm test

# Watch mode (auto-rerun on changes)
npm run test:watch

# With coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Integration tests with mocked Spotify API responses
- Performance benchmarks for large genre lists
- Property-based testing with generated inputs
- Snapshot tests for specific user profiles
- E2E tests for the full OAuth → sorting → display flow
